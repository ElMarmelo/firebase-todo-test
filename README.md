# Introduction
I'm not a great programmer being honest, the purpose of this small applet was to learn basic CRUD operations in firebase using Cloud Firestore as a database, and Tailwind CSS as an UI library

## How to start
Everything is ready to go except the **firebase.js** file, as this project uses Firebase for the backend I cannot provide my private keys for the project, in this case you should head to [Firebase's console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), and get your own credentials, set them in your own .env file, you can also refer to the [Example .md file I provided (Even though it might be mediocre)](https://github.com/ElMarmelo/firebase-todo-test/blob/master/.env.example) and just replace the values for the ones you're going to use (*Remember to remove the .example from the filename!*)

### Stuff I used

- Create React App to set up the project quickly
- Libraries: ReactJS (Mainly useState hook), TailwindCSS (Setting up the look for the different components in the app)
- Backend: Firebase FireStorage (Backend, database creation for basic CRUD operations)
- Git & Github: Self explanatory

### Will I update this ever again?
- Probably not, this was just a short test made in under two or three hours to learn some basic firebase, .env management and react useState hooks
